    <p> I have a strong passion for photography and web/graphic design. I maintain a personal website to showcase my photography, semester abroad experience and personal blog. The  site uses a mix of PHP and JavaScript. The most difficult aspect in creating the site was  implementing a lightbox gallery to showcase my photos; they are pulled directly  from my Flickr account and are not stored locally on the web server. In order  to accomplish this I utilized two different open source lightboxes and edited the  JavaScript to display the photos, while also auto generating the galleries based on the Flickr album ID. </p>
    
    <p><em>Nothing to Drink</em></p>
    
    <p>An additional project under my development is the creation of a website and app called "Nothing to Drink." This project will be composed of a PHP site utilizing a mySQL database for information storage, and will allow users to submit and receive drink recipes based on various ingredients on hand.</p>
