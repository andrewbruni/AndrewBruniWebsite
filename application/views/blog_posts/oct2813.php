        	<p id=blogPostP> Last week passed by fast. I had gone out on Monday night to the bars to watch the soccer game, Bilbao has a decent team, especially since they only recruit players born and raised in the Basque country.

  			Wednesday I had a linguistics exam... I got my score back today and actually passed with a much better score than I imagined, so that was nice. Not sure if you know the differences between [x], [X] and [h] or the seven different types of [n]'s... but there are differences...

            Thursday night, we went out with a bunch of friends from school to one of the local clubs and stayed out all night. Pretty normal for the locals to stay out until 5 or 6 in the morning. Finally, Saturday night we went out again and hung out with some locals. Found late night kebabs and pizza and continued on to a bar for the rest of the night.

            Coming up this week, I have a presentation on Thursday, which is also Halloween, and my sister's birthday. Other than that, not much. There is a soccer game tonight, so we may go watch the game at a bar on Poza street.
