        	<p id=blogPostP>Half the week has passed and I've been here a month now, doesn't feel like it at all. Tonight we went out to celebrate another friends 21st birthday but didn't stay out too late because I have class at 9am. Tonight I am going with three others to Pamplona, where on Friday morning we will start are small 50 mile trek along a part of the Camino de Santiago. We will stop Friday night and Saturday night in small towns along to route on our way to Logrono. On Sunday night, if all goes according to plan, we will take the bus bake to Bilbao. I've never done something like this before, so it will be an experience I'm looking forward to.

            I am in the middle of trying to figure out what to bring aside from socks, more socks and my camera... But, I'll be sure, no matter what, to take as many pictures as I can along our way. I'll be sure to post pictures and an update on Monday.
