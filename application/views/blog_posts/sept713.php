        	<p id=blogPostP>It rained yesterday evening, but didn't stop us from going out with friends for the night. Today it rained on and off all day while on our tour to Guernica, the town that Franco had bombed in the late 30's to try and damage the Basque resistance during the civil war of Spain. The tour of the city itself was interesting with a lot of historical points of interest, including a bomb shelter that we were able to go inside of. We concluded the day with a tour of the Peace Museum, which was very cool.

           I am posting some new pictures from our tour, included is a panorama of one of the parks we walked through. I think it ended up being something like 4 feet wide, hope it looks good.</p>
