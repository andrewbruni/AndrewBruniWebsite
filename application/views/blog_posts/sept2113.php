        	<p id=blogPostP>The week passed by quickly and without much hassle in regards to school and any homework. I did book my tickets to go to London in November to visit my roommate; it's a trip I'm really looking forward to as I've never been to the UK before. On Friday night, the Guggenheim Museum opened up the main floor to hold a kind of dance party; something like a club with DJ's and a drinks. Afterwards, some of the group went home, some went to another club, and myself and some others walked around the city for a bit.

            This morning we woke up around 11am and wandered on over to the beach, just a 15 minute metro ride away from our apartment. We ate lunch at a cafe overlooking the shore and then layed out on the sand for the rest of the afternoon. It was a sunny day and we had great weather for swimming and tanning.

            Tomorrow morning, we have our tickets bought to take a bus over to Santander for the day. I plan on sitting around at the beach all day and just relaxing.
