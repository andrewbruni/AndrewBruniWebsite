        	<p id=blogPostP>Finally got all the pictures up from our weekend trip. The hike was 68km in total (42 miles)and it took us three days to finish. Along the way, we were very fortunate enough to meet some interesting people and see some amazing sights.

            We took a bus to Pamplona on Thursday night and arrived at the Hemingway Hostel (which we only booked an hour before leaving...) around 11:00pm. The next morning we got a slow start and walked over the the office of the camino to get our official credentials of the pilgrim, a sort of stamp book to keep track of our progress. After getting the stamp books we headed out of the city towards Puente de la Reina.

            The first day was longer than the other two because it was a lot of uphill hiking. It took us about 8 hours, including our breaks and stop for lunch, to reach Puente de la Reina. We stopped at Hostel Jakue, where we sat down immediately and had a drink before venturing out again to get food for dinner. The hostel was okay, we met some nice people and had a good time, but others weren't as fortunate because the ceiling leaked during the night.

             We decided the next morning to wake up earlier and get a faster start. The next 22km was easier, we kept a good pace with only one stop and hiked for around five and a half hours. Once we made it to Estella, we found a cafe with a Menu de los Peregrinos and sat down for lunch expecting to continue to hike another 9km. Towards the end of lunch it started pouring rain and we gave up on the idea of walking more and found a hostel for the night.

             We checked in to the Estella city hostel where we ended up rooming with two of the same people we met the night before. For dinner, we ran to the store and got some stuff to make omelettes with and I made everyone some food. We had to be at our next stop, Los Arcos, by 2:30pm the next day in order to catch our bus home, so we decided to wake up at 6:00am and leave by 7:00am.

             At 7:00am, we were out the door and on our way. After the first 9km, we had made it to our final stretch, 12 more kilometers without any towns or stops. By the last 5km, we were nearing Los Arcos, and from there I could actually hear the race track. We could hear the GT3 cars racing that day pretty much until we reached the town, so I took my earbuds out and listened to that.

             By 12:30pm, we had made it to Los Arcos, in time to catch the bus and eat a giant lunch. We had a great lunch at a small cafe where we sat outside on the terrace beside the cathedral. Once the bus arrived, we took it to Logrono and made our connecting bus back to Bilbao.

             Overall, it was a great weekend and I had a ton of fun. I'd love to do it all over again with the same group of friends given the chance.
