    	 I finally had the chance to sit down and update my site. A new page was added with my resume, updated email links, updated and phone numbers.
    
    <br />
    <br /> 
    
    Biggest change was the complete overhaul of the navigation menus. A new CSS style is being used, a cleaner, crisper button style.

				My trip to Rome was quick but fun. I left mid day on Friday to the Bilbao airport for my flight and arrived in Rome around 4:00pm. Getting from the airport to the hotel was easy as there is a train called the Leonardo Express that goes directly from the Rome airport to the main train station where the two metro lines meet as well. Once at the train station, I bought my three day metro pass and found my way to the hotel. I stayed at the Hotel King which was just a few blocks from both the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps. 
            
             <br />
             <br />
             
             	After checking into my hotel, I settled in and unpacked quickly so that I could go walk around before dinner. I made my way to the Trevi Fountain because I wanted to find out if the gelato shop I visited eight years ago with my family during one of our trips to Italy was still there. It was, and it still tasted amazing. 
                
             <br  />

              <br /> 
              <br />
              
              Once I finished eating my gelato, I setup my tripod and camera and started snapping photos of the fountain. It was just as crowded as I had remembered so it was a bit difficult to find somewhere with a clear view to set my camera and make sure that no one would walk into the frame of the photo. I tried out a few different spots and ended up pretty happy with the results. Following that, I walked over to the Spanish Steps hoping that it would be lit up with Christmas lights, but it wasn't. They were in the process of decorating the tree at the top, but, it was not lit up yet. I sat down and watched everyone walk by for a while; I really enjoyed watching all the street vendors try and harass everyone to buy their laser pointers, stress balls, roses, whatever they had that absolutely no one wants or needs. 
             
              <br />
              <br /> 
              
              I took a few photos of the steps that turned out to be meh, and proceeded to wander over to the Vatican to go take a look at St. Peter's Basilica lit up at night. The square was very quite and only a few people were out and about, so I took my time and wandered around the square looking for a good place to setup my camera. Around 8:00pm, I packed up and headed back towards my hotel to find a place to eat for dinner. I chose a random restaurant on the same street as my hotel that looked somewhat busy and was given a table immediately. I looked over the menu and decided on ordering the spaghetti sciglio; it was spaghetti with a tomato sauce, mussels, clams, squid, and prawns. It was delicious and I used an entire basket of bread to soak up the rest of the sauce after I was done eating. 
              
              <br /> 
              <br /> 
              
              After dinner, I walked back to my room, got my key and turned in for the night so that I could get an early start on Saturday. 
                
              <br  /> 
              <br  />

              <br  /> 
              <br  /> 
              
              Saturday morning I woke up around 8:00am and went to grab a quick breakfast of pineapple juice and toast. I walked over to the metro station and got on the train headed towards the Vatican. I wanted to get in line early to go inside St. Peter's Basilica but expected a huge line. Surprisingly, there was nearly no line and I was able to walk right in only having waited about ten minutes total. 
              
              <br  /> 
              <br  /> 
              
              Inside the Basilica I walked all over and I made sure to rub the foot of St. Peter's statue for good luck, just as I had done eight years ago on our family trip. I also made sure to get as close as I could to Michelangelo's Pietà because I wanted to get a good picture this time around. <b><a id="blogPa" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/99327312@N03/11276869603/" target="_blank">I think it turned out okay.</a></b>
              
              <br />
              <br /> 
              
              Following that, I continued on my way to the Sistine Chapel. During the short walk along the Vatican wall, I think I was asked at least six times to pay for a tour in order to skip the long lines at the Vatican Museum. After saying "No" to every one of them, I again expected a long line once I arrived. Turning the corner to the entrance, there was nobody in line, I was able to walk right in and buy my ticket with no hassle.
              
              <br  />
              <br  />
              
              I took the short route through the museum, stopping and gazing at random pieces of art that caught my eye and eventually made it to the Sistine Chapel. The ceiling was amazing and watching all the tourists pass through was kind of amusing. Many got yelled at for not following the rules of not wearing hats inside. 
              
              <br />
              <br /> 
              
              After seeing the Sistine Chapel, I took the metro straight to the Colosseum and got in line for my ticket. The wait wasn't too bad, about 35 or 40 minutes, but it allowed me to get my ticket for both the Colosseum and the Roman Forum. Once I got my ticket, I headed inside and walked around to take some photos. The main floor was super crowded so I went up to the second level and found an empty spot to stop and stare at everything. A half hour later of walking around, I left to visit the Roman Forum. I took my time walking around the Forum and taking pictures of anything I thought looked interesting and just took in the sights of all the old ruins. 
              
              <br /> 
              <br /> 
              
              I didn't have too much planned for the rest of the afternoon, so I found a restaurant near the Colosseum to have a pizza. I sat outside and enjoyed a big pizza with possibly the most expensive can of Coke I have ever drank... It was five Euro just for the soda... The pizza was good though! 
              
              <br /> 
              <br /> 
              
              <a href="application/images/pizza.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="application/images/pizza.jpg" width="200" height="155" /></a> 
              
             <br /> 
             <br /> 
             
             Following lunch, I headed over to see the old Circus Maximus, but it was full of construction equipment, piles of dirt and dead grass. Disappointed by that, I headed back to the hotel to take a break and rest before heading back out. 
             
             <br /> 
             <br />
             
             I rested up and caught up with text messages before I headed out again to the Trevi Fountain. I walked around the area, got gelato again from the same shop, shopped for Christmas gifts and continued on to the Pantheon. I was able to get a really nice photo with the moon in the background. 
             
             <br /> 
             <br />
             
             When I finished up taking photos there, I moved on and walked to Plaza Navona to check out the Christmas Market. The market ended up being more of a carnival for little kids with candy, games and games. I then walked across the city back to the Colosseum so that I could take some night shots of it. Along the way I stopped in front of Plaza Venezia to take photos of the Christmas tree they had put up. The lighting was odd because they had flood lights from the roof tops illuminating the entire plaza, so there was a bunch of stray light, but I got one good shot out of it. 
             
             <br /> 
             <br />
             
             By the time I finally made it to the Colosseum, it was sufficiently dark, around 7:00pm and I walked around the back to a little hill and set up my tripod. I stood around for about 45 minutes taking random pictures and finally packed up to head out to dinner. I had looked up a place that had great reviews and supposedly great spaghetti and was looking forward to eating there. I found the restaurant in a back alley near the Trevi Fountain, it was a small hole in the wall but was packed. The whole time I was eating, people came and went and it seemed to be very popular. I ordered some broschetta with artichoke to start and for my main course I had spaghetti with vodka sauce. I finished my meal with some tiramisu and called it a night. I walked back to the hotel ready to get to bed so I could get an early start Sunday morning and head back to Bilbao.  
             
             <br /> 
             <br />
             
             Overall, my weekend was awesome and I enjoyed having the weekend to myself. Being able to walk all over, at my own quick pace and stop to take as many photos as I wanted was a lot of fun and I'd definitely not hesitate to take solo trips again in the future.

			This past weekend my family came to visit me in Spain! My parents, sister, her best friend, Uncle, and a good family friend all flew out for a 5 day trip. 
            
            <br /> 
            <br /> 
            
            <b> Day 1: </b> 
            
            <br /> 
            On Friday the 29th, my friend Seth and I flew to Barcelona to meet my family who arrived shortly after us. We met our van driver to take us to the hotel and chatted with him while we waited for my parents and everyone else to get through Spanish customs. The driver told us about places to go and see while in Barcelona and about some of the night life. Once my family showed up, we set off for the hotel. My Dad booked rooms at Hotel 1898; the rooms were amazing. It was great to be able to sleep on an actual bed; it was a bed where my feet didn't hang off the end, a bed with actual sheets and real pillows. Leaving that at the end of the weekend was the hardest part of the trip.

            <br />

            After checking in, our plans were to head over to the Boquerilla on Las Ramblas, the main street in Barcelona. The Boquerilla was a giant indoor/outdoor market with fresh seafood, meat, fruits and vegetables, home made juices and tapas bars. We walked around picking and choosing little things to buy and eventually found a tapas bar that looked delicious for lunch. We sat down and ordered a bunch of plates to share. Chicken, steak, octopus, shrimp, patatas bravas (think very thick home fries with a spicy ketchup sauce) and beers were all outstanding. 
            
            <br /> 
            <br /> 
            
            Following lunch, we wandered over to the history museum and toured that. They had an interesting setup that displayed how buildings and the city was laid out in the old ages. Finally, we ended our walking around by visiting the cathedral of Barcelona. We were able to ride the elevator to the roof and walk along the scaffolding setup and see the city from up high.
            
            <br />
            <br /> 
            
            Late Friday afternoon we found a wine bar and had a few glasses before heading back to the hotel so that some of us could sleep. My Mom, Dad, Seth, and I walked back to the Boqueria to pick up some snacks for later and then returned to the hotel for drinks at the bar. Dinner that night was at a Catalan restaurant called Set Portes (Seven Doors), we ate everything they had in the kitchen. We ordered appetizers of croquettes, mussels in garlic sauce, fried spinach fritters, and canenoles to start. For the main course we ordered two paellas (one meat and seafood and the other vegetable with chicken) and a seafood platter that had lobster, prawns, hake, monkfish and cod. Everything was delicious and we couldn't quit eating. At the end of the night we went to sleep on the clouds that were our beds set to start the next day at 7:30am. 
            
            <br />
            <br />
            
            <b> Day 2: </b>
            
            <br /> 
            
            Saturday the 30th, we all woke up bright and early to catch a train from Barcelona to the Monastery of Montserrat. We jumped on the hour and a half train to the cliffs where we took a cable car straight up the face of the mountain. The ride lasted about 5 minutes <a id="blogPa" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmBzm8CdUiA&feature=youtu.be"><b>(Click here for a video time lapse!)</b></a> and was pretty breathtaking just because of how high up everything was. 
            
            <br />
            <br  />
            
            At the monastery we walked around the cathedral and stayed for part of mass to watch the mens choir sing. After that, my sister, her friend and my Mom lit candles to place next to the church. We headed out to grab a quick lunch before taking the cable car back to the train. 
            
            <br />
            <br  />
            
            Once back in Barcelona we headed straight towards Guadi's Sagrada Familia and immediately got in line to buy tickets to view the inside. After about 40 minutes of waiting we finally were able to get inside to view the incredible interior of the cathedral. The stained glass, arches, stair cases, and domes inside were filled with intricate designs that were beyond beautiful. Nothing I've seen has compared to it, a mix of modern and ancient styles. 
            
            <br />
            <br  />
            
            The rest of the afternoon, we split up. My parents and Uncle went to a fabric store so that my Mom could find some fabric for her craft work <a id= "blogPa" href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/tracyBdesigns" target="_blank"><b>(Check out her online shop here!)</b></a> and Seth and I took the girls back to the hotel. We met up later with my parents and Uncle to grab some tapas before getting drinks and going to dinner. 
            
            <br />
            <br /> 
            
            For dinner Saturday night my Dad had made reservations at Petit Comite, a restaurant where I had the best duck I think I've ever had. We ordered a few tapas for appetizers: croquettes, asparagus with an almond dressing, soup, patatas bravas. For our main course, everyone ordered their own dish, like I said earlier, the duck was amazing. It was topped with a sweet date sauce that was perfect. For desert, I had the flan, always good. 
            
            <br  />

            <br />
            <b> Day 3: </b>
            
            <br  />
            
            Our third day in Barcelona was spent at Guadi's Park Guell. The park sat atop of Barcelona and from the very tip you could see the entire city. The architecture in the park was interesting, everything rounded and covered in mosaic tiles. The park is definitely something everyone should go see if they ever find themselves in Barcelona. 
            
            <br  />
            <br  />
            
            After the park, we headed back to collect our bags and found our way to the train station to take the 6 hour train ride back to Bilbao. We sat in 1st class with seats that had plenty of leg room and snacked on wine, chocolate and candied almonds. Eventually, we saw the the can of Coca-cola I had was labeled with my Dad's name, he was very excited.
            
            <br  />

            <br  />
            <br  />
            
            Upon our arrival to Bilbao, I rushed everyone to the hotel to check in so that we could run over to a bar on Poza Street to catch the rest of the Bilbao Athletic vs. FC Barcelona game. We made it to the bar just in time to grab some pinchos, drinks and watch Bilbao win the game. We also ran into some of my friends from school who I introduced quickly to everyone. 
            
            <br  />
            <br  /> 
            
            <b> Day 4: </b>
            
            Monday rolled around and I skipped my classes in order to take a day trip with my family to Burgos. My Dad had arranged for a driver to take us there; his name was Alfonso and he was awesome. He always had something good to say and took us on a side trip to a monastery that was free to the public. 
            
            <br  />
            <br  />
            
            In Burgos we were lucky enough to see the Christmas market outside of the cathedral where we ate some baklava and drank some hot wine. After out snack, we went inside to tour the church. They had some cool art work and statues but it wasn't as big or impressive as what we saw in Barcelona. 
            
            <br  />
            <br  />
            
            For lunch, we stopped a restaurant called Ojeda where I had some roasted lamb. Like everything else I ate last weekend, it was also delicious. Towards the end of lunch, we called up Alfonso to take us back to Bilbao. Once there, we split up. My Dad, Uncle and his friend went to the old town to grab some beers and pinchos, while I took my Mom around to different fabric stores. 
            
            <br /> 
            <br />
            
            Later that afternoon we all met back up to bar hop for drinks and more pinchos. Eventually we ended up at Cafe Iruña where we stayed all night to eat pinchos and drink wine. They had really good lamb shish kebabs that I couldn't get enough of. 
            
            <br  />
            <br  />
            
            <b> Day 5: </b>
            
            <br  />
            
            On Tuesday morning, I got up early to meet my Uncle and head over to the town of Eibar to tour the AYA Shotgun factory. We spent the entire morning there gawking at all the guns and taking a tour of the factory. The shotguns they make are amazingly hand crafted and my Uncle ended up picking one out to buy. The factory gave him a huge array of options to choose from and took measurements to custom fit the gun to him. It was a lot of fun and was pretty cool to see how the guns are actually made.

            <br  />
            <br  />
            
            After the factory, we made it back to Bilbao to meet back up with everyone else. I took everyone around a bit of the city; we walked past the Guggenheim, through my school, and ended at the Bilbao maritime museum. After that, everyone kind of did their own thing before heading over to my host parents house to meet and greet. I went and got some new shirts with my Dad, the girls went with my Mom to go shopping and my Uncle and Bob did their own things.

            Around 7:45pm, I took my parents to meet my host family just before dinner. It was nice that my Dad is able to speak Spanish because other wise it would have been 8 people just standing and staring at each other twiddling their thumbs... After that, we left for our dinner at Guira, a restaurant in Bilbao that was featured in the Michelin 2013 guide book.

            Everything we ate the last night was great. My Dad and Bob both had a Basque specialty of squid prepared in their own black ink. My Mom had cod prepared in the two most popular ways, Viscaina and Pil-Pil. Seth, Rene and the girls had a steak covered in a cheese sauce and I had filet topped with foie gras and a sherry sauce. We finished the night with desserts and wine. A perfect dinner to end a great family trip.

            I'm glad I got to share my time in Spain with my family and they made the weekend as wonderful as it could have possibly been. I cant wait the 2 more weeks until I get home to the US to spend more time with them. Tomorrow, I leave for my last trip of my time abroad; I'm heading to Rome on my own to re visit everything my family saw when there 8 years ago. The pictures from this past weekend and this coming weekend will be up next week, just didn't have time this week to edit all of them.
