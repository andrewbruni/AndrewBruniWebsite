            It's been a week or so since my last post, nothing major has happened. This past weekend I did not go on any trips and there were 3 Spanish holidays, so everything seemed to be closed the entire weekend. Not much other than catching up on sleep was accomplished.

                However, tomorrow, I leave for Dublin! I am flying in to Dublin tomorrow afternoon to meet up with my roommate for the weekend. So far we have plans to visit the Guinness Storehouse for a tour and a pint of fresh Guinness and to visit a cigar bar for some Irish whiskey and a cigar. Other than that, our plans are up in the air. I mainly want to walk around the city and am looking forward to eating some flavorful food (Spain has no idea what spices are other than olive oil, salt and garlic...).

                I return on Sunday afternoon and will be sure to share all my photos from the weekend and type up a quick post to share all the details.
