				My trip to Rome was quick but fun. I left mid day on Friday to the Bilbao airport for my flight and arrived in Rome around 4:00pm. Getting from the airport to the hotel was easy as there is a train called the Leonardo Express that goes directly from the Rome airport to the main train station where the two metro lines meet as well. Once at the train station, I bought my three day metro pass and found my way to the hotel. I stayed at the Hotel King which was just a few blocks from both the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps.

             	After checking into my hotel, I settled in and unpacked quickly so that I could go walk around before dinner. I made my way to the Trevi Fountain because I wanted to find out if the gelato shop I visited eight years ago with my family during one of our trips to Italy was still there. It was, and it still tasted amazing.

              Once I finished eating my gelato, I setup my tripod and camera and started snapping photos of the fountain. It was just as crowded as I had remembered so it was a bit difficult to find somewhere with a clear view to set my camera and make sure that no one would walk into the frame of the photo. I tried out a few different spots and ended up pretty happy with the results. Following that, I walked over to the Spanish Steps hoping that it would be lit up with Christmas lights, but it wasn't. They were in the process of decorating the tree at the top, but, it was not lit up yet. I sat down and watched everyone walk by for a while; I really enjoyed watching all the street vendors try and harass everyone to buy their laser pointers, stress balls, roses, whatever they had that absolutely no one wants or needs.

              I took a few photos of the steps that turned out to be meh, and proceeded to wander over to the Vatican to go take a look at St. Peter's Basilica lit up at night. The square was very quite and only a few people were out and about, so I took my time and wandered around the square looking for a good place to setup my camera. Around 8:00pm, I packed up and headed back towards my hotel to find a place to eat for dinner. I chose a random restaurant on the same street as my hotel that looked somewhat busy and was given a table immediately. I looked over the menu and decided on ordering the spaghetti sciglio; it was spaghetti with a tomato sauce, mussels, clams, squid, and prawns. It was delicious and I used an entire basket of bread to soak up the rest of the sauce after I was done eating.

              After dinner, I walked back to my room, got my key and turned in for the night so that I could get an early start on Saturday.

              Saturday morning I woke up around 8:00am and went to grab a quick breakfast of pineapple juice and toast. I walked over to the metro station and got on the train headed towards the Vatican. I wanted to get in line early to go inside St. Peter's Basilica but expected a huge line. Surprisingly, there was nearly no line and I was able to walk right in only having waited about ten minutes total.

              Inside the Basilica I walked all over and I made sure to rub the foot of St. Peter's statue for good luck, just as I had done eight years ago on our family trip. I also made sure to get as close as I could to Michelangelo's Piet√† because I wanted to get a good picture this time around. <b><a id="blogPa" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/99327312@N03/11276869603/" target="_blank">I think it turned out okay.</a></b>

              Following that, I continued on my way to the Sistine Chapel. During the short walk along the Vatican wall, I think I was asked at least six times to pay for a tour in order to skip the long lines at the Vatican Museum. After saying "No" to every one of them, I again expected a long line once I arrived. Turning the corner to the entrance, there was nobody in line, I was able to walk right in and buy my ticket with no hassle.

              I took the short route through the museum, stopping and gazing at random pieces of art that caught my eye and eventually made it to the Sistine Chapel. The ceiling was amazing and watching all the tourists pass through was kind of amusing. Many got yelled at for not following the rules of not wearing hats inside.

              After seeing the Sistine Chapel, I took the metro straight to the Colosseum and got in line for my ticket. The wait wasn't too bad, about 35 or 40 minutes, but it allowed me to get my ticket for both the Colosseum and the Roman Forum. Once I got my ticket, I headed inside and walked around to take some photos. The main floor was super crowded so I went up to the second level and found an empty spot to stop and stare at everything. A half hour later of walking around, I left to visit the Roman Forum. I took my time walking around the Forum and taking pictures of anything I thought looked interesting and just took in the sights of all the old ruins.

              I didn't have too much planned for the rest of the afternoon, so I found a restaurant near the Colosseum to have a pizza. I sat outside and enjoyed a big pizza with possibly the most expensive can of Coke I have ever drank... It was five Euro just for the soda... The pizza was good though!

             Following lunch, I headed over to see the old Circus Maximus, but it was full of construction equipment, piles of dirt and dead grass. Disappointed by that, I headed back to the hotel to take a break and rest before heading back out.

             I rested up and caught up with text messages before I headed out again to the Trevi Fountain. I walked around the area, got gelato again from the same shop, shopped for Christmas gifts and continued on to the Pantheon. I was able to get a really nice photo with the moon in the background.

             When I finished up taking photos there, I moved on and walked to Plaza Navona to check out the Christmas Market. The market ended up being more of a carnival for little kids with candy, games and games. I then walked across the city back to the Colosseum so that I could take some night shots of it. Along the way I stopped in front of Plaza Venezia to take photos of the Christmas tree they had put up. The lighting was odd because they had flood lights from the roof tops illuminating the entire plaza, so there was a bunch of stray light, but I got one good shot out of it.

             By the time I finally made it to the Colosseum, it was sufficiently dark, around 7:00pm and I walked around the back to a little hill and set up my tripod. I stood around for about 45 minutes taking random pictures and finally packed up to head out to dinner. I had looked up a place that had great reviews and supposedly great spaghetti and was looking forward to eating there. I found the restaurant in a back alley near the Trevi Fountain, it was a small hole in the wall but was packed. The whole time I was eating, people came and went and it seemed to be very popular. I ordered some broschetta with artichoke to start and for my main course I had spaghetti with vodka sauce. I finished my meal with some tiramisu and called it a night. I walked back to the hotel ready to get to bed so I could get an early start Sunday morning and head back to Bilbao.

             Overall, my weekend was awesome and I enjoyed having the weekend to myself. Being able to walk all over, at my own quick pace and stop to take as many photos as I wanted was a lot of fun and I'd definitely not hesitate to take solo trips again in the future.
