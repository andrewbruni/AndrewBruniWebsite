        	<p id=blogPostP>After going out last night for our friend's 21st birthday we spent the day catching up on sleep (One of the benefits of having no Friday classes). We later ventured out to a bar down the street for some drinks and to hang out. The first week of school went well, my classes were enjoyable and my professors seem great. I am taking four classes here which will translate to me bringing back 9 credits towards my Spanish minor and another 6 towards general electives.

            Tomorrow our school group will be taking a trip to Pamplona where we will tour the city and spend the night. Just one of our many trips to come and I am looking forward to all of them. </p>
