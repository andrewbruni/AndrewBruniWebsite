			This past weekend I took a trip to London with a couple friends to meet up with our other friend, Skyler, who is studying abroad in London.

            We arrived at around 11pm and hopped on a train to Liverpool Station. After trying to figure out the subway system and getting lost because lines were closed... we managed to get on a bus and get close enough to our hostel to walk the rest of the way. After finding the right bridge to walk across the river, we stopped to take a few pictures and continued to the hostel.

            The next morning we woke up early for breakfast and met with Skyler to start touring around the city. We walked to see the London Eye, Parliament, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, the Tower of London, London Bridge and Harrods in West London. We also managed to see the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace. Pretty much did every touristy thing possible in the few hours we had. (I'm also pretty sure I have like 12 pictures of people taking photos with iPads...)

            For lunch on our first day, Skyler and I went to a res tar aunt called Nando's which was recommended by a friend here in Deusto. It was really good for a quick sit down place; we had some chicken wings with fries, coleslaw and a cider. The others in our group wanted Chipotle, and because it does not exist in Spain, had planned for weeks to get it in London.

            Dinner rolled around and I found an Indian place that looked inexpensive and had good reviews, so, we decided to try it out and all shared different curry dishes. It was nice to have some flavourful food for once while abroad.

            The following day, the girls woke up early and went souvenir shopping while the guys slept in and checked out of the hostel a little later to meet them. We wandered over to a tea house for an English breakfast and a cup of tea. I had a small pot of apple tea, which was good, but I think I'll stick to coffee.

            After breakfast we headed over to Platform 9 3/4 at King Cross Station because the girls wanted to take photos there (I've never even heard of it. Seth, Skyler and I just sat around). The last thing we did was run back over to Big Ben so the girls could do some more shopping. I went over to a pub with Skyler and Seth to have a drink instead. Quickly after we left for the airport and managed to make it back to Bilbao without any problems.

            Coming up this week, I have my second conversation presentation on Thursday. On Friday, Skyler shows up to hang out for the weekend. The following week, my family is coming to visit and the finally, the next week I plan on going to Zurich or Rome. The next 3 weeks will be exciting and I cant wait.
