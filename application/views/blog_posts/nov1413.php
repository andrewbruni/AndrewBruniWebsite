            This past week was fun, I finally got over my cold and am feeling much better. My friend Seth's parents were in town last weekend and they invited me to visit San Sebastian with them. We spent Saturday walking around the city and stopped to have a delicious lunch at a pintxo (pincho) bar.

       On Wednesday my cooking class cooked up the famous Spanish dish of paella. It turned out really good and was very filling. We also made some stuffed tomatoes for an appetizer and torrijas for dessert (think french toast).

       	     Tomorrow, I leave for London. Looking forward to seeing a new city and taking lots of pictures. So far we have no real plans and are just going to wing it. I'll get back to Bilbao on Sunday night and will be sure to start uploading photos. Only 4.5 more weeks left after this weekend, time seems to have flown by way to fast. The next 3 weekends though will be a lot of fun and I can't wait.
