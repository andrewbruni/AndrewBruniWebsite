        	<p id=blogPostP>This weekend we went for a weekend trip to the cities of Pamplona and Logroño. Pamplona is known best for the running of the bulls as well as having the worlds 3rd largest bull fighting arena. On the short city tour we got to see the route of the bull running, the city center and the old walls. Logroño is known for their production of Rioja wine. While there, we toured the Ontañon winery and attended a small wine tasting. We then took the bus into the countryside and visited, only from the outside this time, two other wineries and were able to see rows upon rows of grape vines.

            The next two weekends are open, but October and November will be filled with travel. I am starting the second week of class tomorrow and looking forward to it.
