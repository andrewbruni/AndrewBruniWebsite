            Finally got my Adobe Certification in order... was finally able to find the document so I can display the tag on my site... that was a pain. But hey, it's there now, for good.

            Last Thursday was Halloween and also my little sister's birthday. Belated Happy Birthday to her, I can't wait until you come visit at the end of the month!

            The week passed fast and Thursday night came along, I put together a super last minute costume. Ended up finding a cape and printed some Batman logos out. It was cool to see some Spaniards dress up because they do things differently. In Spain, most everyone dressed up as something legitimately scary, while all the Americans dressed up funny.

           We headed to District 9, a club in Bilbao for the night and didn't get to sleep until after 6:00 am. On Friday night I went out with some different friends for dinner and drinks and walked around the Casco Viejo (Old Town) for the rest of the night.

           Finally, Saturday and Sunday were not very lively. I tried to watch the Texas game online but could not find it... Instead I watched the Florida vs. Georgia game and watched the Gators lose horribly.

           Woke up this morning with a headache and feeling like I had a cold, so I went to my first class and called it quits. Went back home and slept for the rest of the day; I now feel a lot better, so hopefully that is the end of that. Other than that, I am counting down the days until I go to London and then when my family visits, can't wait.
