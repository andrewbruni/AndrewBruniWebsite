        	<p id=blogPostP>My mobile version of the site is up and running finally (Chris...), it should work on anything from a retina iPad to an old smart phone. Pretty happy about that. Next step is integrating facebook comments, but that's for another day.

           <br /> Yesterday Seth and I met our host family, Yosune and Juseff. They are a couple in their late 20's early 30's who are very excited to have us and speak Spanish with us. The apartment is smaller, but we both have our own rooms, its pretty much what I expected.

            <br /> Today we took our language proficiency exams and attended a quick school orientation. Later we toured the city as a group and had lunch with everyone else. Tomorrow comes more school meetings and a school tour, I'm looking forward to getting started next week.</p>
